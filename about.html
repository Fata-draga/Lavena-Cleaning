                    <h2>Our Professional Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        Lavena Cleaning was founded by a professional with extensive experience in the UK healthcare
                        sector, including a background in nursing and domiciliary care.
                        This perspective shapes an approach that prioritises more than surface cleanliness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our understanding of clinical standards and patient care translates into our cleaning
                        methodology.
                        We are specialists who appreciate the importance of infection control, risk assessment, and
                        safeguarding.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Commitment to Compliance and Safety</h2>
                    <p>Our healthcare experience informs a rigorous commitment to safety and compliance, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Infection Prevention and Control:</strong> Applying hospital-grade principles to
                            every job.</li>
                        <li><strong>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):</strong> Correct selection and use of PPE to
                            prevent cross-contamination.</li>

                    </ul>
